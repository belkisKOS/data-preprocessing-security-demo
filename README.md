# data-preprocessing-security-demo
## Project Purpose

This project demonstrates a **data preprocessing workflow** with an emphasis on **data security**. The goal is to preprocess the Titanic dataset, demonstrate how to apply security measures such as **data encryption at rest**, and securely store and transfer data using AWS services.

## Tools Used

- **Python**  
  - pandas, matplotlib, seaborn for data analysis and visualization  
  - cryptography, boto3 for data security management (encryption via AWS KMS)
  
- **AWS**  
  - Amazon Web Services (S3, KMS) for data storage and key management
